# VueJS Animation Techniques Presentation ðŸŽ‰
Are you tired of static and boring user interfaces? Do you want to create dynamic and engaging experiences for your users? Look no further than VueJS animation techniques!

This presentation covers a variety of animation techniques in VueJS that will take your user interfaces to the next level. From class-based animations to state-driven animations, animating with watchers, and The <Transition> Component & TransitionGroup, you'll learn the tools you need to create visually stunning and responsive interfaces.

## Topics Covered
ðŸš€ Class-based animations: learn how to define CSS classes to describe the animation, and use Vue.js to add and remove these classes based on state changes.

ðŸŒŸ State-driven animations: use Vue.js' reactive data properties to trigger animations based on changes in state.

ðŸ‘€ Animating with watchers: use watchers to trigger animations based on changes in data properties.

ðŸŽ¬ The <Transition> Component: use Vue.js built-in <transition> component to apply enter/leave transition effects to an element when it is inserted/removed from the DOM.

ðŸ‘¥ TransitionGroup: use the Vue.js <transition-group> component to animate a list of items as they are added, removed or moved around on the page.
